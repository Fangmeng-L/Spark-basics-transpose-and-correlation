# Spark basics transpose and correlation
 A school project/ exercise about the basics of pyspark including join, transpose, correlation, etc.    
The context for project Tasmania:    
In a remote part of the world, hidden somewhere in Tasmania, researchers of climate change decided to place a steel vault about the size of a school bus. It will operate much like a plane’s black box, and its mission will be to inform whoever discovers it about the end of human civilization. In other words, it will serve as a guide for a post apocalyptic society. It will create an archive for the future habitats of earth that could be critical in forming their society by piecing together the missteps of humanity, should humanity be destroyed by climate change. The box will record leaders’ actions (or inactions) by scraping the internet for keywords relating to climate change from newspapers, social media and peer-reviewed journals. It will collect daily metrics,including average oceanic and land temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and biodiversity loss. For the purposes of this project, I will assume that I am the future species of earth that discovered the Tasmanian box. I will simplify the analysis to just two datasets. One recording temperature changes and the other recording CO2 emissions.
